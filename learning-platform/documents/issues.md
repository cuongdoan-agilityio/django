# Practice issues
- Not analyzing the refactoring of the previous practice code carefully leads to time delay.
- Should choose to do unit testing from the beginning (For example, pytest or django's default), to avoid making the code asynchronous.
- Additional requirements for previous activities need to be analyzed more carefully, avoiding duplication or omission, for example.
- Missing API to support password change.
- The unit test coverage is incomplete.
- Service layer separation not completed.
- Many APIs lack try-except.
- Need to flatten api directory of all module, move views, serializers go out of api directory.
