# Practice issues

- Incomplete requirement analysis leads to redundant fields in DB design.
  - The result is many redundant fields, spending a lot of time refactoring code.
- The way of doing the work is not suitable, too much customization, not taking advantage of Django admin.
  - Should discuss with supporters, give personal solutions, agree on the appropriate way of doing with supporters.
- Database queries are not optimized.
